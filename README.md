✋ Gesture-Driven Particle Universe

An interactive 3D particle system controlled entirely by hand gestures using MediaPipe Hands, Three.js, Fingerpose and real-time physics — no controllers, no keyboard, just your hands.

This project transforms webcam hand-tracking into a gesture-controlled creative engine & mini arcade game.

🚀 Live Features
Gesture / Action	Result
🤏 Pinch	Scale the entire particle galaxy
👍 Thumbs-Up	Particles are pulled toward your hand (gravity well)
✌ Peace	Particles explode away (repulsion field)
👉 Swipe Left / Right	Switch between particle presets
✍ Draw in Air	Paint glowing cosmic trails
🎯 Touch Bubbles	Pop floating bubbles & increase score
🖐 Fast Hand Motion	Creates brighter, faster particle storms
🧠 Tech Stack

Three.js — GPU-accelerated 3D rendering

MediaPipe Hands — real-time hand landmark tracking

Fingerpose — gesture recognition engine

Custom Physics Engine — attraction & repulsion fields

Pure Browser Runtime — no backend, no installs

🎮 Gameplay Mode

The system includes a hidden gesture-controlled arcade mode:

Floating bubbles spawn every 2 seconds

Touch bubbles with your fingertip to score points

Score is tracked live in the UI

All motion is physics-driven — no mouse or keyboard needed

💡 Why This Project Stands Out

This is not a demo — it’s a human-computer interaction experiment showing how:

Vision-based interaction can replace hardware controllers

Gestures can become a full interaction language

Particles can behave like living matter through physics fields

It demonstrates real-time CV integration, shader-based rendering, gesture recognition, spatial mapping and user-experience design.

🛠 Setup
git clone https://github.com/barnikbasu/hand-gesture-particles
