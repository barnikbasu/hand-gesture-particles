# ✋ Gesture-Driven Particle Universe

An interactive **3D particle system controlled entirely by hand gestures** using  
**MediaPipe Hands, Three.js, Fingerpose and real-time physics** — no controllers, no keyboard, just your hands.

This project transforms webcam hand-tracking into a **gesture-controlled creative engine & mini arcade game**.

## 🚀 Features

| Gesture / Action | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| 🤏 Pinch | Scale the entire particle galaxy |
| 👍 Thumbs-Up | Particles are pulled toward your hand (gravity well) |
| ✌ Peace | Particles explode away from your hand (repulsion field) |
| 👉 Swipe Left / Right | Switch between particle presets |
| ✍ Draw in Air | Paint glowing cosmic trails |
| 🎯 Touch Floating Bubbles | Pop bubbles & increase score |
| 🖐 Fast Motion | Creates brighter, faster particle storms |

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Three.js** – GPU-accelerated 3D rendering  
- **MediaPipe Hands** – real-time hand landmark tracking  
- **Fingerpose** – gesture recognition engine  
- **Custom Physics Engine** – attraction & repulsion fields  
- **Pure Browser Runtime** – no backend, no installations

## 🎮 Arcade Mode

The project contains a hidden **gesture-controlled mini-game**:

- Floating bubbles spawn every 2 seconds  
- Touch a bubble with your fingertip to pop it  
- Score updates live on screen  
- Entirely controlled using your hand — no mouse or keyboard
